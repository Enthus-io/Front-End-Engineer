These changes are a type of state change. CSS transitions allow us to control the timing of visual state changes. We can control the following four aspects of an element’s transition:

Which CSS properties transition
transition-property: color;
    Transition-property declares which CSS property will be transitioning, the text color.
How long a transition lasts
transition-duration: 1s;
    Transition-duration, declares how long the transition will take — one second.

How much time there is before a transition begins
transition-timing-function: ease-out;
    The next transition property is transition-timing-function. The timing function describes the pace of the transition. The default value is ease.
    ease-in — starts slow, accelerates quickly, stops abruptly
    ease-out — begins abruptly, slows down, and ends slowly
    ease-in-out — starts slow, gets fast in the middle, and ends slowly
    linear — constant speed throughout
How a transition accelerates
transition-delay: 250ms;
    transition-delay. Much like duration, its value is an amount of time. Delay specifies the time to wait before starting the transition.
    As with the duration property, the default value for transition-delay is 0s, which means no delay.
  
Shorthand
transition: color 1.5s linear 0.5s;
    CSS provides a property that can be used to declare them all in one line: transition. This shorthand property describes each aspect of the transition
    puzzle in a single declaration. The properties must be specified in this order:
        transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, transition-delay.
  
Combinations
transition: color 1s linear, font-size 750ms ease-in 100ms;
    you can describe unique transitions for multiple properties, and combine them. To combine transitions, add a comma (,) before the semicolon (;) in your rule.

All
transition: all 1.5s linear 0.5s;
    It is common to use the same duration, timing function, and delay for multiple properties. When this is the case you can set the transition-property value to all.
