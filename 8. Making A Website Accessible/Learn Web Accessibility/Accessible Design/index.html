    ACCESSIBLE DESIGN
Review
You gained some knowledge on web accessibility and how to make your websites usable for all users.
      
Remember, the keys to building a more visually inclusive Web are:
      
Using contrast so our text and colors provide better visual cues
Using correct font size so our content is legible
Creating user interfaces that are enhanced by, but not dependent on, color -->

ACCESSIBLE DESIGN
Contrast
Contrast refers to the opposition of different properties (color, size, shape, font, etc) to make one object visually distinct from another.
In this lesson, we will cover creating accessibility-enhancing contrast through:

Headings
    they create structure, dividing your page into groups of increasingly specific content
    they create visual contrast, with lower-numbered headers like h1 displaying in a larger and more striking format
    they provide navigation and contextual information to web browsers, plugins, and assistive technologies like screen readers.
Font choices
    screen readers can transform the text into a voice-over
    users can scale or magnify the text for better legibility without losing image quality
    itâ€™s less taxing on the browser to load real text versus requesting large image assets from a server.
Color
    Choosing highly contrasting colors (opposite from each other on a color wheel) will aid users with partial color blindness.
    Using a color scheme with multiple shades of brightness for a single color will create contrast for users with partial or total color blindness.
    Pairing color with other forms of conveying information (text, icons, etc) is the most general solution. -->

                    <p>You can bake the cupcakes the night before and decorate these the next day. I would frost them the same day you plan on serving them for best results.
