Review
Letâ€™s review.
  
HTML creates the skeleton of a webpage, but JavaScript introduces interactivity.
You link to external JavaScript files with the src attribute in the opening <script> tag.

By default, scripts are loaded and executed as soon as the HTML parser encounters them in the
HTML file, the HTML parser waits to load the entire script before from proceeding to parse the
rest of the page elements.

The defer attribute ensures that the entire HTML file has been parsed before the script is
executed.

The async attribute will allow the HTML parser to continue parsing as the script is being
downloaded, but will execute immediately after it has been downloaded. -->

  <script src="./script.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <section class="container">
      <img src="normal.png" id="frame" />
      <p id="banner" onclick="blooming()">Enthus.io</p>
    </section>

    <section onclick="newStyle();">
    <p class="centered" id="logo">Dev</p>
    </section>

	</body>

<!-- The <script> element has an opening and closing tag. You can embed JavaScript code inbetween the
 opening and closing <script> tags. -->
    <script>
      function blooming() {
        var image = document.getElementById("frame");
        if (image.src.match("normal")) {
          image.src = "flower.png";
        } else {
          image.src = "normal.png";
        }
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
