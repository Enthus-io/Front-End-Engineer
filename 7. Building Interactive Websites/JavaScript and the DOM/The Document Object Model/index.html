<!-- 
THE DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
Review
Let’s review what you’ve learned so far:

The DOM is a structural model of a web page that allows for scripting languages to
access that page.
The system of organization in the DOM mimics the nesting structure of an HTML document. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<!--   
The element they are nested within is called the parent element of those elements. -->
	<head>
    <!--   	
    Elements nested within another are referred to as the children of that element. -->
    <title>The title</title>
	</head>

	<body>
    <h1>The heading</h1>
    <div>	
    	<p>A summary</p>
    	<p>A description</p>
    </div>	
	</body>

</html>
<!-- 
The DOM also allows access to the regular attributes of an HTML element such as its
style, id, etc. -->
