DOCUMENTATION AND RESEARCH
Documentation
Every well-developed language or framework has a place where you can look up all of its features.
This library of information is called a language’s documentation.

You can find the documentation for CSS at Mozilla Developer Network. In addition to CSS,
The Mozilla Developer Network (referred to as MDN) contains the complete documentation for
HTML, JavaScript, and many other essential tools of web development.


Google
Documentation is an essential tool to learn about properties. However, what if you don’t even know what property you need?

In situations like this, it might come as no surprise that using Google is a great way to read other developers’ solutions to problems.
Googling the problem you’re trying to solve and the language you’re using will yield many useful answers.


DOCUMENTATION AND RESEARCH
Stack Overflow
While using Google in the previous exercise, you may have noticed a lot of links to a site called Stack Overflow.

Stack Overflow is a useful resource where developers ask and answer questions. You should use it to find answers to your questions,
and learn from experienced developers.

Reading all of the top-voted answers to a Stack Overflow question can give you multiple solutions to try as well as an understanding
of why one solution might be better than another. Additionally, if you can’t find a question, you can even ask it yourself and receive answers.
