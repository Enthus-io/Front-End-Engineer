GRIDS AND SPACING
Review

Remember, the reasons we design using grids are:

Promote consistency within our designs
Properly align elements on our page
Provide ample spacing between content
Remember a grid is made up of:

*Columns *Gutters *Margins

Spacing is incredibly important within a design to ensure:

Elements have ample room to breath
Denote emphasis on certain parts of a page
Promote harmonious patterns and rhythms within your designs
By following these guidelines, it will allow you to create elegant and usable sites!
